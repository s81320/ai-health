# Economic Impact of a Data Product (in particluar in AI + Health)

"How can I make money?"

We should: Give an introduction to successful companies that provide interesting data products and make money from it. (How) do they participate in the platform economy?

The topic is in the area / field where business and data science meet.

Companies from Berlin, the US, China? Names Alex Löser dropped: KRY (did not find that), Ada, Babylon

We could give 4 examples of companies that make money in ai and health.

## Structure for our talk

If we each introduce a company that "makes money with ai and health" (as Alex Löser suggested) there has to be some underlying structure, we cannot just talk about 4 random companies. 

Present companies from 3 of the 4 areas of Pasteurs quadrant? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur%27s_quadrant

We need financial data on the companies. For start-ups there is sometimes info on venture capital raised. But on revenues? Start-ups are not at the stock exchange ...
